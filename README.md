#📝 Flutter Notes App
This is a beautifully designed Notes App built with Flutter and Hive for local storage. It allows users to:

✍️ Create, edit, and delete notes

🎨 Choose custom colors for each note

📅 Save the creation date of notes

🧹 Swipe to delete notes easily

✅ Update notes and get feedback with snackbars

The app uses Cubit for state management and follows a clean architecture structure to separate logic from UI. It's a perfect beginner-friendly project to learn Hive, Bloc, and local data handling in Flutter.
